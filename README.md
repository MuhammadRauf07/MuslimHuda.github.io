MuslimHuda ("we," "our," or "us") operates the MuslimHuda mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use the App.

1. Information We Collect

However, the App may collect certain information as described below.

Location access is used solely to calculate prayer times.

We do not store your precise location on our servers.

Location data is processed only as necessary to provide prayer time functionality.

If location permission is denied, prayer time features may not function accurately. Other features of the App will remain available.

You may enable or disable location permissions at any time through your device settings.
